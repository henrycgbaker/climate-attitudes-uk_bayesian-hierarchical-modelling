# Data Documentation

## Data Provenance

The original survey data is from the [Looking for Growth](https://tracker.lookingforgrowth.uk/) tracker, a nationally representative UK survey conducted in 2025.

**The original data is proprietary and not included in this repository.**

Researchers interested in accessing the real data should contact the Looking for Growth project directly.

## Synthetic Data

For demonstration and code testing, synthetic data can be generated using:

```r
Rscript R/00_generate_synthetic_data.R
```

This creates `synthetic/synthetic_survey_data.rds` with 500 simulated respondents.

### Synthetic Data Structure

The synthetic data matches the column structure expected by the analysis pipeline:

| Variable Group | Items | Response Type |
|---------------|-------|---------------|
| Economic Optimism | 6 items (Q43-Q48) | 5-point Likert |
| Environmentalism | 1 binary + 4 Likert (Q121-Q125) | Mixed |
| Radical Reform | 8 items (Q72-Q83) | Binary forced-choice |
| Material Insecurity | 8 items (Q90-Q97) | 4-point frequency |

### Demographics

| Variable | Levels |
|----------|--------|
| Gender | Male, Female |
| Age bracket | 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+ |
| Education | 7 levels (No qualifications to Level 4+) |
| Region | 10 UK regions |
| Party | 10 categories (Green to Won't vote) |

### Generation Method

The synthetic data is generated by:
1. Simulating correlated latent traits (φ, θ, ψ) from a multivariate normal
2. Adding measurement error to generate item responses
3. Converting continuous values to appropriate categorical responses
4. Sampling demographics from UK-representative distributions

**Important**: The synthetic data is for code testing only. Results from synthetic data do not reflect actual UK public opinion.

## Processed Data

After running `01_wrangling.R`, the following file is created:

- `stan_data_full.rds`: List object containing all data formatted for Stan

This includes:
- N: Number of respondents
- X: Covariate design matrix (N × 13)
- Item response data in long format for each measurement block
- Region and party indices
